# todo

## Description

A very classic todo application with the code reviewing user in mind

## Use case

As a user I want to be able to see how the author takes on this task so that I can get insight in how she performs as a developer

## Design decisions

- I've set up the project with a basic webpack configuration, not putting any effort into the production bundles.
- I think it's important to strive to write accessible code but I've not taken action on some of the issues in this example.
- A life changing todo application might need some real stable data storage but a local storage solution seams like a god fit for this example.
- I like to write frontend code in typescript since I believe that type checking makes the developer life easier, more predictable and higher the quality of the project.
- I do miss PR reviews when dancing solo. I do not need someone to lead my way to get going, but I strongly believe that the end result always gets better by collaboration.
- What about the project structure? For this small example it might not be necessary to think big and divide small, but to make components as dumb and generic as possible always seams like a good idea.
- I write code for the code reviewing user as much as the end user. I also think it's fun to improve code over time. Function and variable naming sometimes appear harder than coming up with logical solution.
- A project usually have use of some tests but in this example project I've left it out.
